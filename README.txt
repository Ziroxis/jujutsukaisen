I love open source, that's why this is free to steal. Euh, I mean 'take' code from with no issues for your own mod.
Just please send me a dm on discord(Beosti#2658)or in the discord server(https://discord.gg/vbrM37cBKu) to ask me if it's okay.
You're probably gonna have to give me a shoutout in the code/reade/your discord for me to say yes, just saying already.

The code is not that well documented, feel free to ask me anything in dms for it. It will get documented soon :tm: don't worry about it.

Enjoy the mod!
(Or stealing the code)

P.S. Don't be an asshole just shoot me a dm to ask (except if it's like 5 lines of code, who cares about that)
DO NOT, I repeat DO NOT take models/textures that's a big no no.
